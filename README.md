Access Point WiFi Project
Description
This project aims to explore the functionality of wireless communication libraries on ESP32 microcontrollers. It involves connecting the ESP32 to an existing WiFi network and creating an Access Point (AP) WiFi network for other devices to connect to.

Project Tasks
Connect ESP32 to WiFi: Implement functionality to connect the ESP32 to an existing WiFi network using SSID and password.

Create Access Point WiFi: Configure the ESP32 to create an Access Point WiFi network with a specified SSID and password.

Check Internet Connectivity: Verify if the ESP32 has internet connectivity after connecting to a WiFi network. If not, troubleshoot and identify solutions to establish internet connectivity.

Add TCP Server Setup: Develop functionality to set up a TCP server for configuring WiFi connection parameters such as SSID and password. Implement the ability to switch between different WiFi modes.
